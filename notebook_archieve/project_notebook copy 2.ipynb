    "This notebook implements a sophisticated multi-agent financial analysis system using LangChain and LangGraph. The system is designed to automate the process of investment research by coordinating multiple specialized AI agents to perform complex tasks end-to-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core architecture follows a **Planner-Executor** model, augmented with a **Critique-Refinement** loop to ensure the quality and objectivity of the final analysis. This agentic approach moves beyond simple, scripted pipelines by enabling agents to reason, plan, delegate, and self-correct, mimicking the workflow of a human financial research team."

    "## Agent Design and Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "This system is built on a foundation of several key agentic workflow patterns that enable complex, autonomous behavior. The primary architectural choice is the **Planner-Executor** pattern, which separates the \"thinking\" from the \"doing\" to improve reliability and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Planner-Executor Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow begins with a clear separation of duties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Planning Phase (`planner_node`):** A specialized **Planner Agent** is invoked first. Its sole responsibility is to create a strategic research plan. It performs a single, low-cost action—calling the `get_company_info` tool—to determine the company's market cap and sector. Based on this profile, it dynamically selects the appropriate set of tools for a deeper analysis and outputs its reasoning along with a structured plan (a JSON array of tool names).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Execution Phase (`executor_node`):** The plan is then passed to an **Executor Agent**. This agent's job is to mindlessly and efficiently execute the provided plan. Its internal protocol mandates that it **always** calls `read_notes_from_memory` first to gather historical context. Following that, it sequentially invokes each tool from the planner's list, gathering all the necessary data points before synthesizing an `initial_analysis`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Specialist Agent Delegation (Prompt Chaining)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Execution phase, the `executor_agent` demonstrates another key pattern: delegation to a specialist. When it needs to analyze news, it doesn't process the raw headlines itself. Instead, it calls the **`Financial_News_Analyst` tool**, which is a self-contained agent. This specialist agent performs an entire internal workflow (Ingest → Classify → Summarize) in a single call, returning a concise, high-level summary. This is an example of **Prompt Chaining**."

    "## Agent Functions and Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents in this system are designed with specific functions that align with the core requirements of an agentic AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Planning (`planner_agent`)\n",
    "The system explicitly demonstrates planning capabilities. The **Planner Agent**'s primary function is to create a dynamic, context-aware research plan. It reasons about the company's profile (Penny Stock, Mid-Cap, etc.) and outputs a precise list of tools for the next agent to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dynamic Tool Use (`executor_agent`)\n",
    "The **Executor Agent** showcases dynamic tool use. It is not hardcoded to run a fixed sequence of tools. Instead, it receives a plan as input and dynamically invokes the tools specified in that plan, allowing its behavior to adapt to the specific research task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Self-Reflection (`critic_agent`)\n",
    "Self-reflection is implemented through the **Critic Agent**. After the `executor_agent` generates its initial analysis, the `critic_agent` is invoked to assess the quality of that output. It evaluates the analysis against predefined criteria: **Balance**, **Clarity**, and **Objectivity**, providing structured feedback for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Learning Across Runs (Memory Tools)\n",
    "The system has a persistent memory implemented via the `read_notes_from_memory` and `save_note_to_memory` tools.\n",
    "- At the **start** of every run, the executor agent is mandated to call `read_notes_from_memory`, ensuring it has historical context.\n",
    "- At the **end** of the workflow, the `save_memory_node` generates a concise takeaway from the final report and saves it to a JSON file, allowing the system to learn and improve its context for future analyses of the same stock."

    "## Evaluation and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of this agentic system is its built-in mechanism for evaluation and iterative improvement, which is handled by the **Critique-Refinement** loop. This pattern ensures that the initial analysis does not go unchecked and is refined based on objective feedback before being presented as the final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The process follows a clear three-step pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Generate (`executor_node`):** The **Executor Agent** first produces an `initial_analysis` based on the data it has gathered. This serves as the first draft.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Evaluate (`critic_node`):** The `initial_analysis` is then passed to the **Critic Agent**. This agent acts as an automated quality assurance step. It evaluates the draft against important criteria (e.g., Is it balanced? Does it present both risks and opportunities?) and produces a structured `critique`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Refine (`refiner_node`):** Finally, both the `initial_analysis` and the `critique` are passed to the **Refiner Agent**. This agent's sole purpose is to rewrite and improve the initial draft by explicitly addressing the feedback from the critic. The output of this node is the polished `refined_analysis`, which becomes the final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Generate → Evaluate → Refine** cycle is a powerful form of self-correction that significantly enhances the quality, objectivity, and reliability of the system's output."

    "This project successfully demonstrates the power of a multi-agent system for complex financial analysis. By separating the roles of planning, execution, and critique, the system produces a nuanced and objective report that dynamically adapts its research strategy based on the company's profile. The successful implementation of memory allows the agent to build context over time, making it a truly \"learning\" system. The final output for the test ticker (e.g., UAA) showcases the end-to-end workflow, from initial data gathering to a polished, refined analysis.\n",

    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "While the current system is robust, there are several avenues for future enhancement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback:** The plan generated by the `planner_agent` could be presented to a human user for approval or modification before being passed to the executor. This would add a layer of expert oversight.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Deeper Financial Analysis Tools:** New tools could be developed to parse financial statements (10-K/10-Q) in more detail, extracting specific tables and calculating trends in metrics like revenue, net income, and free cash flow over multiple quarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Visual Data Integration:** The final report could be enhanced by programmatically generating and including visual charts for financial trends or stock performance directly within the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **\"Analyst Verdict\" Scorecard:** A final agent could be added to the workflow to score the company on key factors (e.g., Valuation, Financial Health, Momentum) and produce a quick, \"at-a-glance\" scorecard, providing an even more digestible summary for the end-user."
